# emacs.d

This is not a project itself. Here you will find my emacs LISP scripts. Some of
them depend on some modes or scripts that you should download from ELPA or
MELPA.

Also, my <init.el> will set your emacs to my personal preferences on emacs.

> You may need emacs 25 or higher, since it uses packages heavily. Emacs 24 and
> earlier doesn't support `package-install-selected-packages` instruction.

Hope it help you. 

Have fun.
